dem bois tell a computer what to do

## Install
Do the npm dance :dancer:
```sh
npm i
```
## Spin up the Bot
```sh
npm start
```

## Testing
Run the mocha test suite:
```sh
npm run test
```
Or continuously run mocha. It'll re run the tests as you update the project's code. Super handy for TDD.
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
